# Species Portfolio Effects Dominate Seasonal Zooplankton Stabilization Within a Large Temperate Lake

https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.3889 

Data for this analysis can be found online (https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/lake-simcoe-monitoring). 

# Data Prepping
Download the 1980-2019 csv files and open up the file named "Simcoe_Zooplankton&Bythotrephes.csv". Copy and paste the zooplankton sheet into a new excel file called "Simcoe_Zooplankton.csv". The column ZDATE in the excel file needs to be switched from GENERAL to SHORT DATE so that the dates in the ZDATE column read "YYYY/MM/DD". Save as .csv in appropriate R folder.

# R Scripts

R scripts are numbered (1-10) in the order that they are supposed to be used.

The .csv files produced from the subset R scripts (1, 5, 8) must then be manually edited to remove data that do not have 5 (3 or 7) stations per sampling period as well as by combining data points that should fall into a single week.

R scripts 1-4 represent the analysis of the data when 5 stations are included as well as code for statistical tests, final figures, and supplmemental figures.

R scripts 5-7 represent the analysis of the data when 3 stations are included as well as code for statistical tests and supplmemental figures.

R scripts 8-10 represent the analysis of the data when 7 stations are included as well as code for statistical tests and supplmemental figures.

The folder labelled "Figures" contains the raw figures as they are generated by the R scripts and may not have axes labelled the same as how they appear in the article.
